## My Work

**Quantum Machine Learning and QNNs**
* Published [Medium Article](https://medium.com/studentsxstudents/image-classification-using-quanvolutional-neural-networks-qnn-cd13b287ceca) on the theory behind neural networks and applications of quantum nodes within them to create more efficient models
* Posted a primer [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7T1ndoKDOko) highlighting the technology and intuition behind QNNs

**Working Alongside IKEA to Adapt to Changing Mobility**
* Created Slide Deck highlighting solutions to adapt IKEA's future to changing urban demographics
* Published [Medium Article](https://studentsxstudents.com/what-i-learned-in-a-month-working-alongside-ikea-and-how-you-can-use-it-8e7cc7836b9b) on what I learned from being a PM of a team of 4 in the 4 week Challenge sprint.
