## My Work

**Tungsten: a Wireless, Peer-to-Peer, Power Transfer Infrastructure**
* Published an [article](https://medium.com/geekculture/f-ck-wires-why-we-need-a-new-way-to-transfer-electricity-72495b4947c) on the inefficiencies of the current wired grid transmission
* Created a 90 second [pitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqjPF5WjGNQ&t=1s) highighting our technology
* Won best overall at TKS' moonshot hackathon, presenting to over 200 people
* Currently pursuing lab space for an MVP

**Pricing Options with Quantum Computers**
* Published [article](https://medium.com/geekculture/using-quantum-computers-to-price-options-5bd92ab5fe5c) highlighting the theory behind options, challenges to pricing options classically, and quantum methodologies and circuits to efficiently derive fair values using Quantum Amplitude Estimation
* Created [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3P1LoqZZn0) explaining the article to aid in understanding of formulas and intuition 

**Quantum Machine Learning and QNNs**
* Published [Medium Article](https://medium.com/studentsxstudents/image-classification-using-quanvolutional-neural-networks-qnn-cd13b287ceca) on the theory behind neural networks and applications of quantum nodes within them to create more efficient models
* Posted a primer [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7T1ndoKDOko) highlighting the technology and intuition behind QNNs

**Working Alongside IKEA to Adapt to Changing Mobility**
* Created Slide Deck highlighting solutions to adapt IKEA's future to changing urban demographics
* Published [Medium Article](https://studentsxstudents.com/what-i-learned-in-a-month-working-alongside-ikea-and-how-you-can-use-it-8e7cc7836b9b) on what I learned from being a PM of a team of 4 in the 4 week Challenge sprint.

**Hackathon Pitch: Ammonia Synthesis Using VQE**
* 2 minute [Elevator Pitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ES9J_wwBjY4)
* [Slide Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G6bJ8qxpwb9krw4E6xir4PufhIoFmapOz7qSRLTNp9o/edit?usp=drivesdk)
* Live [Pitch](https://youtu.be/oZY5iE6zhAg) to judges (9:50 - 14:30)
* Won award for best impact from a pool of 89 teams globally

**Grover's Algorithm** 
* Published [Medium Article](https://medium.com/visionary-hub/what-exactly-is-grovers-algorithm-a8f5dce1e1b3) explaining the functionality and physics behind the algorithm as well as examples on 2 and 3 qubits 
* Posted comprehensive [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmB90cPPwAE) that makes the algorithm accessible to those not accustomed to the math behind its function

**[Revolutionizing Finance 1 Qubit at a Time](https://medium.com/studentsxstudents/revolutionizing-finance-1-qubit-at-a-time-5758f82243bb)**
* An introductory article on quantum computing that explains the concepts of superpostion and entanglement
