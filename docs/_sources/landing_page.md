## My Work

**Grover's Algorithm** 
* Published [Medium Article](https://medium.com/visionary-hub/what-exactly-is-grovers-algorithm-a8f5dce1e1b3) explaining the functionality and physics behind the algorithm as well as examples on 2 and 3 qubits. 
* Posted comprehensive [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmB90cPPwAE) that makes the algorithm accessible to those not accustomed to the math behind its function.

**[Revolutionizing Finance 1 Qubit at a Time](https://medium.com/studentsxstudents/revolutionizing-finance-1-qubit-at-a-time-5758f82243bb)**
* An introductory article on quantum computing that explains the concepts of superpostion and entanglement

***Plus many more on the way. Stay Tuned!***
